### Note: You must set your environ variable before running. I can't share my API Key, so get yours by following these steps.
1.  Access your API Key from [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
2.  If you are on Linux/Mac, you need to add a new line to `~/.bash_profile`. Or, any similar script that runs whenever you start the terminal. Example of the line for setting environ var: `export D2_API_KEY=83247983248793298732`. Just in case you are too cnofused, just run this line in terminal before running the program.
